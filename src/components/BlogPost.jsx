The combination of transparency (links to data) and speed (seconds to answers) drives adoption beyond analyst teams.\n\nLeaders should pilot with a constrained set of high-value domains (e.g., revenue, pipeline, support) and measure success by time-to-answer, narrative accuracy, and downstream actionability.
